### Plan:



### Care Management:
  - Spread work across the team
  - Knowledge share with team
  - Look for room to improve process with autoation and tooling



### Platform: (unless we can get Tanuja and Deidrey off of this)
  - Support Tanuja and Deidrey's obligations in platform testing.
  - Knowledge share to rest of the team
  - Look for opportunities to apply automation and tooling to improve the process



##### Replatforming:
### Connectors:
  - Continue developing connector tests agnostic of big data team


##### Replatforming:
###  Measures:
- Cross functional feature team
  - Focused on delivering the feature
    - Its own development cycle
    - Testing as a first-class citizen from the beginning
  - Utilize Tanuja and Deidrey's experience and knowledge
  - Knowledge share with team


##### Replatforming:
### MPI:
- Same deal as measures
- we are too thin as a team to do this is parallel



### Datamart:
  - I think we have the talent in team to do a full feature
  - not in parrallel with Measures or MPI, or anything other than:
    - Care Management
    - Platform



### Bindery:
  - Work close with Tark, effectivley creating a small cross-function team for developing and testing the bindery spark engine.



### Mack:
  - This is a lot of work, we would probably need to focus on this.
  - I don't think this can be in parrallel with Replatforming work, at least we'd need a good chunk of time to spin up on it.
  - We have the tech for productized connectors, but not for informattica, mack testing, or bespoke connectors
